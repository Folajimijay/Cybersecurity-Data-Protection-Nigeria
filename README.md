## 📊 Key Findings

- **67%** of public institutions surveyed adopted a formal cybersecurity policy.
- **Only 54.2%** conduct regular NDPA compliance audits.
- A **strong positive correlation (r = 0.72)** exists between cybersecurity maturity and compliance with data protection law.
- **Major challenges:** funding limitations, lack of skilled personnel, weak executive prioritization.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Mandate adoption of standard cybersecurity frameworks like NIST or ISO/IEC 27001.
- Allocate dedicated government cybersecurity budgets across MDAs.
- Build internal capacity through training and executive engagement.
- Strengthen NDPC’s enforcement power and monitoring tools.
- Leverage public-private partnerships to close technical gaps.
