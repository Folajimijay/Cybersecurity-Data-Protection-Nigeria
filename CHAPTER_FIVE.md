# CHAPTER FIVE  
## Discussion, Conclusion, and Recommendations

---

### 5.1 Introduction

This chapter provides a detailed discussion of the key findings, interprets their implications in the context of the literature reviewed, and presents the conclusion of the study. It also offers practical recommendations for enhancing cybersecurity and data protection compliance in Nigeria's public sector.

### 5.2 Discussion of Findings

#### 5.2.1 Cybersecurity Framework Adoption

The study revealed that although some public institutions have adopted cybersecurity frameworks such as **NIST** and **ISO/IEC 27001**, many others lack formal structures. This aligns with previous findings by Ogbonna et al. (2021), who noted that Nigeria's public sector lacks unified cybersecurity governance. The inconsistent application of security protocols exposes institutions to vulnerabilities and limits their ability to comply with national data protection laws.

#### 5.2.2 Level of Compliance with NDPA 2023

While 75% of respondents confirmed the existence of data protection policies, only 45.8% had trained their staff on the NDPA 2023. This suggests a superficial level of compliance. Similar patterns were reported by NITDA (2023), which found low levels of institutional awareness and enforcement of the Act. The absence of internal audits and proper DPO oversight further hampers genuine implementation.

#### 5.2.3 Relationship Between Cybersecurity and Compliance

The strong positive correlation (r = 0.72) between cybersecurity maturity and NDPA compliance affirms that robust cybersecurity directly enhances institutional readiness and legal adherence. Institutions that implement structured cybersecurity frameworks are more equipped to meet regulatory standards. This supports the assertions of scholars like Adebayo & Fashina (2022), who argue that data protection efforts must be embedded in technical security infrastructures.

#### 5.2.4 Challenges to Cybersecurity and Data Compliance

The most reported challenges include **inadequate funding**, **shortage of cybersecurity talent**, and **low executive prioritization**. These findings reinforce existing concerns raised by NDPC (2023) about the gaps in leadership commitment and technical preparedness across MDAs.

### 5.3 Conclusion

This study set out to examine how cybersecurity acts as a catalyst for strengthening data protection and NDPA 2023 compliance in Nigeria’s public sector. The findings clearly show that cybersecurity readiness significantly enhances data governance capabilities. However, a large number of institutions are still far from full compliance due to structural, financial, and human resource challenges.

Cybersecurity is not just a technical requirement—it is a strategic enabler for legal compliance and public trust in digital governance. Strengthening cybersecurity practices in public institutions is, therefore, essential to achieving the goals of Nigeria’s data protection regime.

### 5.4 Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Mandate Standard Cybersecurity Frameworks:**
   Public institutions should be required to adopt global cybersecurity frameworks such as **NIST**, **ISO/IEC 27001**, or **COBIT** to strengthen their technical compliance with NDPA provisions.

2. **Establish Dedicated Cybersecurity Budgets:**
   Federal and state governments must allocate dedicated funding for cybersecurity initiatives within MDAs to reduce reliance on fragmented IT budgets.

3. **Capacity Building and Awareness:**
   Regular training for staff and executives should be implemented to build internal knowledge and accountability for data protection practices.

4. **Strengthen the Role of the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC):**
   The NDPC should increase its regulatory oversight, including conducting periodic audits and publishing performance scorecards for public institutions.

5. **Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):**
   Encourage collaboration between government and private cybersecurity firms to enhance technical support and bridge the digital skills gap.

6. **Automation and Monitoring Tools:**
   Invest in automation tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and data loss prevention (DLP) to improve threat detection and response.

### 5.5 Suggestions for Further Research

Future studies may explore:

- Cybersecurity compliance in Nigeria's **private sector** organizations.
- Comparative studies between **Nigeria** and other African countries post-GDPR influence.
- Assessment of the effectiveness of NDPA 2023 enforcement mechanisms across MDAs.

### 5.6 Summary

This chapter discussed the study's findings, drew relevant conclusions, and proposed evidence-based recommendations. The research confirms that cybersecurity is a pivotal enabler of data protection in Nigeria's digital public infrastructure. However, for real progress to be made, strategic investments, capacity development, and regulatory enforcement must be intensified.
