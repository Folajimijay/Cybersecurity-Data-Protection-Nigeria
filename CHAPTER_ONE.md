### 1.1 Background to the Study

In the digital age, the safeguarding of personal data has become a critical concern for governments, organizations, and citizens worldwide. With increasing reliance on digital infrastructure, Nigeria faces the dual challenge of harnessing technological innovation while ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information. In response, the **Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023** was enacted to provide a legal framework for data protection and privacy rights, especially within the public sector, where large volumes of citizen data are processed.

Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in the implementation and enforcement of this Act. The adoption of robust cybersecurity practices can significantly strengthen institutional compliance with the NDPA, prevent data breaches, and enhance public trust. However, the level of cybersecurity maturity across Nigeria's public sector remains uneven, and the challenges of policy implementation, infrastructure, awareness, and compliance monitoring continue to persist.

This study explores how cybersecurity serves as a catalyst for strengthening national data protection, focusing on the adoption, enforcement, and impact of cybersecurity strategies within Nigeria’s public institutions.

### 1.2 Statement of the Problem

Despite the growing importance of data protection, many Nigerian public institutions still lack the technical, operational, and administrative frameworks necessary to comply effectively with the NDPA 2023. Cyberattacks, poor enforcement, limited digital literacy, and infrastructural deficits continue to threaten data privacy.

While policies such as the NDPA exist, their successful implementation depends heavily on the cybersecurity posture of public institutions. Unfortunately, there is a gap in empirical research that evaluates the actual impact of cybersecurity adoption on NDPA compliance in the public sector. This study seeks to fill this gap by assessing the role of cybersecurity in enhancing data protection and legal compliance in Nigeria’s public administration.

### 1.3 Objectives of the Study

The main objective of this study is to examine how cybersecurity contributes to strengthening data protection practices and compliance with the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 in public sector institutions.

**Specific objectives include:**

1. To evaluate the current cybersecurity practices adopted by public sector institutions in Nigeria.
2. To assess the level of compliance with the NDPA 2023 across selected institutions.
3. To identify the relationship between cybersecurity adoption and data protection effectiveness.
4. To highlight the challenges hindering cybersecurity implementation and compliance in the public sector.

### 1.4 Research Questions

1. What cybersecurity frameworks are currently implemented in Nigeria’s public institutions?
2. What is the current level of compliance with the NDPA 2023 among public sector organizations?
3. How does the adoption of cybersecurity strategies influence data protection outcomes?
4. What are the key challenges to cybersecurity adoption and data compliance in the Nigerian public sector?

### 1.5 Significance of the Study

This research is significant for several reasons:

- It provides policymakers and regulatory agencies with evidence-based insights to improve cybersecurity strategies.
- It helps public institutions identify gaps in their data protection frameworks and compliance levels.
- It contributes to academic literature on data protection, cybersecurity governance, and regulatory compliance in Africa.
- It supports national digital transformation and trust-building efforts by emphasizing security-by-design principles.

### 1.6 Scope of the Study

The study focuses on federal public sector institutions in Nigeria, particularly those handling large volumes of personal or sensitive citizen data. It assesses cybersecurity readiness, NDPA 2023 compliance, and institutional challenges, using selected Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) as case studies.

### 1.7 Limitations of the Study

- Access to certain classified institutional data may be restricted.
- Response bias may occur in survey responses from public officials.
- Findings may not be fully generalizable to private sector organizations or sub-national agencies.

### 1.8 Definition of Key Terms

- **Cybersecurity**: Measures and controls implemented to protect digital systems, networks, and data from cyber threats.
- **Data Protection**: Legal and technical practices aimed at safeguarding personal data from unauthorized access or misuse.
- **NDPA 2023**: The Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023—a regulatory framework enacted to protect the privacy and rights of data subjects in Nigeria.
- **Public Sector**: Government-owned and controlled institutions, including ministries, departments, and agencies.
