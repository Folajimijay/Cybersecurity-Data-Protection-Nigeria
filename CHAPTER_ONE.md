Chapter One: Introduction

1.1 Background to the Study
The digital transformation of public sector operations in Nigeria has led to an unprecedented increase in the volume of sensitive data being processed by government institutions. From citizens’ biometric information to classified national records, data has become a vital asset. However, the rise of digitization also increases vulnerability to cyber threats such as data breaches, ransomware attacks, and insider threats.

To address these risks, Nigeria enacted the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023, which established a legal framework for data privacy and introduced the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) as the principal regulatory body. However, the effectiveness of this law largely depends on the implementation of robust cybersecurity strategies—especially within the public sector, where resource constraints, policy gaps, and low technical capacity persist.

This study investigates how cybersecurity practices can serve as a catalyst for strengthening national data protection efforts. By focusing on Nigeria’s Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), the research will explore the level of cybersecurity adoption, the challenges faced, and the alignment between existing practices and the NDPA 2023.

1.2 Statement of the Problem
Despite having legal frameworks in place, many Nigerian public sector institutions lack the cybersecurity infrastructure and governance necessary to protect critical data assets. Cyberattacks targeting government systems have increased, often exposing sensitive data due to poor cyber hygiene, lack of awareness, and minimal compliance with national standards. This gap between legal obligation and practical implementation raises concerns about the resilience of Nigeria’s data protection ecosystem. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of cybersecurity adoption in the public sector is urgently needed to bridge policy with practice.

1.3 Research Objectives
This study aims to:

Examine the level of cybersecurity adoption across selected public sector institutions in Nigeria.

Evaluate the effectiveness of current cybersecurity measures in enhancing national data protection.

Identify key challenges hindering cybersecurity implementation in public institutions.

Analyze the alignment between public sector cybersecurity practices and the NDPA 2023.

Propose actionable recommendations to strengthen cybersecurity governance for improved data protection.

1.4 Research Questions
What is the current level of cybersecurity adoption in Nigeria’s public sector?

How effective are existing cybersecurity measures in protecting sensitive public sector data?

What are the major barriers to cybersecurity implementation in public institutions?

To what extent are current cybersecurity practices aligned with the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023?

What strategic interventions can improve cybersecurity readiness across public agencies?

1.5 Significance of the Study
This study is significant for policymakers, data protection officers, IT professionals, and regulatory bodies. It will offer evidence-based insights into the state of cybersecurity in public institutions and highlight gaps that undermine compliance with the NDPA 2023. The findings can guide policy formulation, capacity-building programs, and technology investments to foster a more secure public data ecosystem.

1.6 Scope of the Study
The research will focus on selected Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) in Nigeria, particularly those with high volumes of personal or national data. It will assess cybersecurity infrastructure, policies, workforce capacity, and incident response readiness within these institutions.

1.7 Limitations of the Study
Potential limitations include limited access to internal cybersecurity frameworks due to confidentiality, the possibility of low survey response rates from government staff, and time constraints in gathering data from multiple agencies.

1.8 Definition of Key Terms
