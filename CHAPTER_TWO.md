# CHAPTER TWO  
## Literature Review

### 2.1 Introduction

This chapter reviews existing literature on cybersecurity, data protection, and the regulatory landscape in Nigeria, particularly focusing on public sector adoption. It provides a conceptual framework for understanding how cybersecurity measures can bolster compliance with data protection laws such as the **Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023**. The review draws on global best practices, case studies, policy analyses, and scholarly discourse.

### 2.2 Conceptual Clarifications

#### 2.2.1 Cybersecurity  
Cybersecurity refers to the protection of systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, or damage. It encompasses technical safeguards, policies, and procedures designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems (NIST, 2020).

#### 2.2.2 Data Protection  
Data protection involves legal and organizational measures to ensure that personal data is processed lawfully, transparently, and securely. In Nigeria, the NDPA 2023 sets out rights for data subjects and obligations for data controllers and processors.

### 2.3 Theoretical Framework

This study adopts the **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** and the **Institutional Theory** to explore cybersecurity adoption in the public sector. TAM explains how perceived usefulness and ease of use influence technology adoption, while Institutional Theory highlights the role of regulations, norms, and cultural pressures on institutional behavior.

### 2.4 Review of Global Best Practices

Countries like Estonia, the UK, and Singapore have successfully integrated cybersecurity into their national data protection frameworks. These nations emphasize:
- **Robust cybersecurity frameworks**
- **Public sector digital transformation**
- **Clear accountability and incident response mechanisms**

Lessons from these jurisdictions demonstrate that effective cybersecurity governance is a prerequisite for strong data protection compliance.

### 2.5 Cybersecurity Landscape in Nigeria

Nigeria faces significant cybersecurity threats, including phishing, ransomware, and identity theft. Despite the establishment of the **National Cybersecurity Policy (2021)** and **NITDA’s guidelines**, public sector agencies often lack:
- Adequate infrastructure
- Skilled cybersecurity personnel
- Consistent policy implementation

The NDPA 2023 represents a step forward but requires integration with strong cybersecurity frameworks to be truly effective.

### 2.6 Public Sector and Data Governance

Studies reveal that many Nigerian public institutions struggle with digital governance. Manual processes, poor record-keeping, and weak digital infrastructure undermine data security. Compliance with previous frameworks like the **NDPR (2019)** was low, suggesting that similar challenges could hinder NDPA 2023 implementation unless cybersecurity becomes a foundational pillar.

### 2.7 Challenges to Cybersecurity Adoption in the Public Sector

- **Limited Budgetary Allocation** for cybersecurity  
- **Lack of Cybersecurity Awareness and Training**  
- **Absence of Standardized Protocols**  
- **Weak Enforcement of Policy Frameworks**

These issues reinforce the need for capacity-building and a shift in strategic priorities at institutional levels.

### 2.8 Empirical Review

Numerous studies affirm the positive correlation between cybersecurity maturity and data protection compliance. For instance:
- **Okafor & Oluwatosin (2022)**: Found that public sector data breaches often result from poor cyber hygiene.
- **World Bank (2021)**: Recommended cyber capacity audits in African governments to reduce digital vulnerability.
- **Gartner (2020)**: Highlighted that 78% of compliant organizations integrated cybersecurity into their data governance strategy.

### 2.9 Research Gaps Identified

While previous research focuses on cybersecurity threats or general compliance issues, there is limited empirical work examining:
- **How cybersecurity readiness affects NDPA 2023 compliance**
- **Sector-specific challenges in Nigeria’s public institutions**
- **User perceptions of cybersecurity tools in enforcing data protection rights**

This study seeks to bridge these gaps.

### 2.10 Summary of Literature Review

The literature reveals that without a sound cybersecurity foundation, data protection efforts—no matter how comprehensive—may be ineffective. Global best practices support the idea that proactive cybersecurity adoption enhances legal compliance. However, Nigeria’s public sector still faces structural, technical, and institutional barriers to achieving this synergy.

This sets the stage for the next chapter, which discusses the methodology employed to investigate these relationships within Nigeria’s public sector.
