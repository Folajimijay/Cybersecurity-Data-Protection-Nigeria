The chapter begins with a demographic overview, followed by descriptive and inferential statistical analyses based on the research questions and objectives.

---

### 4.2 Response Rate

Out of the 30 questionnaires distributed to selected public sector institutions:

- **27 responses** were received, resulting in a **90% response rate**.
- **3 were incomplete** and discarded, leaving **24 valid responses** for analysis.

|                           | Compliance Officer            | 7         | 29.2%      |
|                           | Legal/Data Protection Officer | 7         | 29.2%      |
| Years of Experience       | Less than 5 years             | 6         | 25.0%      |
|                           | 5–10 years                    | 12        | 50.0%      |
|                           | More than 10 years            | 6         | 25.0%      |
| Institution Type          | Ministry                      | 8         | 33.3%      |
|                           | Department                    | 10        | 41.7%      |
|                           | Agency                        | 6         | 25.0%      |

### 4.4 Research Question One:  
**What cybersecurity frameworks are currently implemented in Nigeria’s public institutions?**

Respondents were asked about the existence and type of cybersecurity frameworks in use:

- **67%** reported having a formal cybersecurity policy.
- **50%** adopted the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**.
- **29%** used **ISO/IEC 27001**.
- **25%** had no structured framework but operated based on IT team discretion.

**Interpretation:**  
While some institutions have adopted global standards, there is a lack of uniformity and enforcement across the public sector.

### 4.5 Research Question Two:  
**What is the level of compliance with the NDPA 2023 among public sector organizations?**

| Compliance Indicator                      | Compliant (%) | Non-Compliant (%) |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Data processing policy in place           | 75%           | 25%               |
| Data Protection Officers appointed        | 62.5%         | 37.5%             |
| Annual compliance audits conducted        | 54.2%         | 45.8%             |
| Staff trained on NDPA regulations         | 45.8%         | 54.2%             |

**Interpretation:**  
Compliance with the NDPA 2023 is still evolving, with partial adoption of key mandates. Many institutions have not fully implemented mandatory controls like staff training and annual audits.

---

### 4.6 Research Question Three:  
**How does the adoption of cybersecurity strategies influence data protection outcomes?**

A Pearson correlation analysis was conducted between cybersecurity maturity score and NDPA compliance score.

- **Pearson correlation coefficient (r):** 0.72  
- **Significance level (p-value):** 0.001

**Interpretation:**  
There is a strong, statistically significant **positive correlation** between the implementation of cybersecurity measures and compliance with data protection regulations. Institutions with mature cybersecurity frameworks are more likely to be NDPA-compliant.

---

### 4.7 Research Question Four:  
**What are the key challenges to cybersecurity adoption and compliance in the Nigerian public sector?**

| Challenges Identified                      | Frequency (%) |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Inadequate funding                         | 70.8%         |
| Lack of skilled cybersecurity personnel    | 66.7%         |
| Low executive buy-in and prioritization    | 54.2%         |
| Obsolete infrastructure                    | 50.0%         |
| Regulatory ambiguity                       | 41.7%         |

**Interpretation:**  
Major challenges include resource constraints and a lack of technical capacity. These hinder the effective implementation of both cybersecurity measures and compliance with the NDPA 2023.

---

### 4.8 Summary of Key Findings

- A significant number of public institutions lack formal cybersecurity structures.
- Compliance with the NDPA 2023 is partial and inconsistent.
- Strong positive correlation exists between cybersecurity maturity and legal compliance.
- Key challenges include funding, human capital, infrastructure, and regulatory clarity.

### 4.9 Summary

This chapter analyzed the data collected through questionnaires and interviews. It revealed a clear link between cybersecurity adoption and NDPA compliance in Nigeria’s public sector. The findings highlight both progress and persistent gaps in implementation.

The next chapter will discuss the findings in the context of existing literature and provide recommendations for enhancing data protection through cybersecurity.
