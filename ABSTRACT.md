**Cybersecurity as a Catalyst for Strengthening National Data Protection in Nigeria: A Study of Public Sector Adoption**

---

# üìÑ Abstract

In today‚Äôs digital era, the safeguarding of personal and institutional data is a national priority. With the enactment of the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023, the Nigerian government has signaled a firm commitment to enhancing data protection practices, especially within public sector institutions. This study explores the critical role of cybersecurity as a catalyst for achieving effective data protection under the framework of the NDPA.

Focusing on public institutions across Nigeria, the research investigates the extent of cybersecurity adoption, the level of awareness and compliance with the NDPA, and the barriers impeding implementation. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire administered to IT personnel, compliance officers, and administrators within government ministries, departments, and agencies.

Findings reveal that while awareness of cybersecurity and data protection is growing, significant gaps exist in formal policy adoption, staff training, and compliance enforcement. Many institutions face challenges such as inadequate funding, outdated infrastructure, and a shortage of skilled personnel.

The study concludes that cybersecurity is not just a technical requirement but a strategic enabler for sustainable data protection. It recommends increased government investment, continuous staff capacity building, and a stronger alignment of institutional cybersecurity frameworks with NDPA standards. These actions are essential to strengthening Nigeria‚Äôs national data protection posture and ensuring trust in public digital services.
